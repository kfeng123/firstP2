\section{Conclusion remark}

This paper is concerned with the problem of testing the equality of means in the setting of high dimension and spiked covariance. We removes big variance terms from $T_{CQ}$ and it's power is boosted substantially. The asymptotic normality of the new statistic is proved and the asymptotic power is given. %The new test outperforms $T_{CQ}$ substantially if the variance is spiked.
%We also generalize the test to unequal variance case.

In another paper,~\cite{Zhao2016A} proved their test statistic can be written in the form of projection. Their simulation results showed that their test performs well under strong correlations.
Our work partially explains why their test performs well although the projections are slightly different. 

 Spiked covariance is an important correlation pattern and has been widely studied in terms of PCA\@. In PCA, authors focus on the principal subspace. However, our work shows that in some circumstance, the complement of principal subspace is more useful. 


Our theoretical results rely on the assumption $\sqrt{p}/n\to 0$. In the situation of small sample or very large $p$, the critical value of the new test can be determined by permutation method. Our simulation shows that the new test still performs well. It remains a theoretical interest to study the asymptotic behavior of permutation based test in these situations.
