1. state that LRT can not be used since eigenvalue and eigenvectors can not be estimated consistently, refer to some literatures. Make clear spiked model and factor model are similar.

2. add the part of large eigenvalues by Fan's method

3. make clear the advantage corresponding to Aoshima's paper: less restriction of p

8. Study the property when not converge

9. permutation
